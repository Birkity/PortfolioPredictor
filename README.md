## **📊 Project Name: Stock Market Data Analysis and Visualization Pipeline**

### **🌟 Overview**

This project involves building an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing stock market data using Tesla (TSLA), S&P 500 (SPY), and Bond (BND) datasets. The pipeline encompasses data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization, adhering to **industry standards** for modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

The project demonstrates:

- **Advanced Python coding practices** for data pipelines.
- Clear logging for debugging and tracking processes.
- Clean and modular design for reusability.
- Visual storytelling through data visualization.
- Preparation for advanced tasks like unit testing, CI/CD integration, and MLOps.
